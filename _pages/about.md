Hi! My name is Meenakshi Sharma and I am a PhD student from University of jammu,India. I am working with ALICE Collaboration. To know more about this you can visit [this site](https://http://alice.web.cern.ch/). 
   I am working on data anaysis and it involves analysis of the strange particle production.Several experimental observables, sensitive to the evolution of the system after the nuclear collisions, reveal important important information about the properties of the QGP. Among such observables is the production rate of strange quarks. It is now confirmed that the strange quarks would be produced with higher probability in a QGP scanario with respect to that expected in a pure hadron gas scenario. The studies are now revised at much higher LHC energies and are compared with the lower energy measurements to clarify the full picture.
